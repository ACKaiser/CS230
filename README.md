Operating Platforms

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, has a game called Draw It or Lose It. The client wants to improve the software by expanding it to platforms beyond just Android. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I identified the various platforms and evaluated their advantages and weaknesses. I determined the development language and tools for creating the application. I also discussed the various browsers and the considerations for supporting the multiple clients. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped to focus the project and determine what was important for the client. It pointed to where the most time and attention needed to be. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Recommending the amount of RAM was difficult to calculate. Also, determining with precision what operating platform architecture was appropriate. Discussing how the clients communicate with the servers and discussing the concepts of REST were difficult to articulate clearly.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I attempted to anticipate how the users would interact with the game across the various platforms. The game needed to be consistent across all platforms. The users ultimately decide the success or failure of the game. If they have issues with the security or interacting with the game, that can lead to a failure of the application.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The focus needed to be on creating clear and concise documentation of the clients wants and needs. The game needs to be easily updated and maintained for future growth. In the future I would attempt to have a better understanding of calculating an applications RAM needs and how REST ties into the security of the final application.
